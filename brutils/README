This README describes generic views, querysets and middleware in the system

=Custom Middleware And Context Processors=
The Custom Middleware is designed to add parameters to the requests going in and out so that the logged in staff member is available using request.staff
and the logged in store is available using request.store instead of having to query for each everytime a request is made. The Custom Context Processor is the same
and will make store and staff available within a template when it is rendered.

=Decorators=
The Decorators available are used in views to make sure the staff member has access to certain modules as defined in their permissions. This whole system is based
around the existing SPAN system. See the Staff model and permissions field.
