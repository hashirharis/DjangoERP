This README describes ownerships, groupings and user Permissions in the system

'models' are all the Django models that inherit from the abstract Django Model : StoreLevelObject.

=Ownerships=
- Bi-Rite Head Office is the root store that can edit/update and delete all the models, but based on the privelege levels of the staff only some can fully do so.
    - All stores under the Bi-Rite StoreGroup can view the products if they are marked as shared
- All other stores fall under Bi-Rite Head Office and can also have their own models which can only be edited and deleted by the store that created it.
    - Only this store can view the model unless more stores appear under this Stores StoreGroup and the product is marked as shared

==In Summary A Model can only be viewed by a store if it==
- Created it
- Falls Under the StoreGroup of the store that created it AND it is a shared Model

==In Summary A Model can only be deleted/edited by a store if it==
- Created it
- Only Staff with a privelege level of 2 or up can delete/edit a model.

=Users and Permissions=
- The Django user is the Bi-Rite store and a custom user has been created to represent a Staff Member.
- Store Profile (Django User Profile) has been created for each store so the store admin settings are stored in that profile.
- Staff members are represented by the Staff model

==Staff Permissions==
- Staff Permissions follow the same pattern as SPAN and can be seen in the Staff Model privelegeLevel
- Access is restricted to each module and SOME modules can only be access if the staff member is signed in.
